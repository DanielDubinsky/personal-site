## Summary

In drug discovery, assessing cell viability is critical but often relies on destructive "endpoint" assays (like measuring ATP), which kill the culture and prevent further analysis. This project introduces **Neural Viability Regression (NViR)**, a deep learning-based method that quantifies culture viability non-invasively using standard microscopy images.

By preserving the culture, NViR enables tracking of the same sample over time, capturing temporal changes and significantly reducing costs.

## Key Innovation: Neural Viability Regression (NViR)

NViR replaces the destructive chemical assay with a computer vision proxy. The model takes a bright-field microscopy image of a spheroid and regresses the viability score (normalized ATP level).

### Technical Architecture
*   **Backbone:** ResNet18 pre-trained on ImageNet.
*   **Head:** MLP regression head.
*   **Input:** Bright-field microscopy images of liver spheroids.
*   **Output:** viability score (normalized ATP).

The model was trained on a dataset of human liver spheroids exposed to various compounds.

## Application: Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Prediction

To validate the method, NViR was applied to the task of predicting Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI).
*   **Dataset:** 108 FDA-approved drugs.
*   **Method:** Spheroids were imaged over time while exposed to drugs.
*   **Result:** The viability profiles generated by NViR accurately distinguished between toxic and non-toxic drugs, matching the performance of destructive gold-standard assays but with a fraction of the cost and labor.

## Impact

1.  **Non-Invasive:** Enables "online" monitoring of experiments without destroying samples.
2.  **High-Throughput:** Automated imaging allows for massive scaling of viability screens.
3.  **Cost Reduction:** Eliminates expensive reagents needed for chemical assays.
